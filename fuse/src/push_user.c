// If <push_groups> is non-zero, we also save the current per-process
// group-list, lookup the group-list for the new euid, and install that as
// the process group-list.  Apparently, Linux processes have a group-list.
// Setting euid/egid doesn't change the set of groups associated with this
// process (well, setegid() adds one element).  Presumably, this is an
// efficiency hack, to avoid having to lookup groups all the time.
// However, it means that after setting euid/eguid, files that ought to be
// inaccessible to the new user, based on group-access, might be
// accessible.
//
// For example, if we start fuse as root, the initial process group-list is
// just (0).  After seteuid(500), setegid(500), the process group-list is
// (500, 0).  This user will be able to read the following directory:
//
//    drwxrwx---. 2 root root 4096 Jan 21 14:49 secret_root_stuff
//
// However, chgrp 500 on this file will fail:
//
//    -rwxrwx---. 1 500 502 0 Jan 15 08:31 share_with_502
//
// even if user 500 is a member of group 502.  That's because the
// group-list of the process is (500, 0), which doesn't include 502.
//
// The solution to both these problems is to have push_user() save the
// original process group-list, go get the group-list for user 500, and
// install it as the process group-list.  We have to do this before
// seteuid(), because it requires reading /etc/passwd.  Then, we undo these
// actions in pop_user().
//
// That sounds expensive.  We probably don't want to do it when we don't
// have to, like in write().  So, we'll make it an option.
