//     get the size, we need to go stat the PFS file, instead.  If we wrote
//     this flag in an xattr, we'd have to read xattrs for every stat, just
//     so we can learn whether the file-size returned by 'stat' is correct
//     or not.
//
//     (b) on a directory, the setuid-bit indicates MD-sharding.  [FUTURE]
//     In this case, the MD-directory will be a stand-in for a remote MD
//     directory.  We hash on a namespace + directory-inode and lookup that
//     spot in a remote-directory, to get the MD contents.

// --- Looking for "marfs_close()"?  It's a combination of "marfs_flush()".
//     and "marfs_release()"

// Fuse "flush" is not the same as "fflush()".  Fuse flush is called as
// part of fuse close, and shouldn't return until all I/O is complete on
// the file-handle, such that no further I/O errors are possible.  In other
// words, this is our last chance to return errors to the user.
//
// Maybe flush() is also the best place to assure that final recovery-blobs
// are written into objects, and pending object-reads are cut short, etc,
// ... instead of doing that in close.
//
// TBD: Don't do object-interaction if file is DIRECT.  See marfs_open().
//
// NOTE: It also appears that fuse calls stat immediately after flush.
//       (Hard to be sure, because fuse calls stat all the time.)  I'd
//       guess we shouldn't return until we are sure that stat will see the
//       final state of the file.  Probably also applies to xattrs (?)
//       But hanging here seems to cause fuse to hang.
//
//       BECAUSE OF THIS, we took a simpler route: move all the
//       synchronization into marfs_release(), and don't implement fuse
//       flush.  This seems to have the desired effect of getting fuse to
//       do all the sync at close-time.
//
// UPDATE: FUSE calls release() asynchronously, and ignores the return values
//         from the call. This leaves us vulnerable to silent data loss if the
//         call to release() fails. We need to take all the steps which may
//         fail here, in marfs_flush(), so we can return an error to the user.
//         These steps are:
//         - writing recovery info
//         - the final close of the object stream
//         - writing the final chunkinfo (for MULTI files)
//         - writing the POST xattr
//         - truncating the metadata file
//         - removing the restart xattr
//         However, this isn't as simple as moving the code from release() to
//         flush(). FUSE may call flush() multiple times for a given file,
//         once each time a reference to that file is closed (this happens
//         in the case of dup'd fds, ie. when redirecting output from the shell.

   //
   // SOLUTION: set the RESTART xattr flag.  It will be clear that this
   //     object hasn't been successfully closed, yet.  It will also be
   //     clear that this is not one of those files with no xattrs, so open

// doesn't have access to the open-flags, whereas create() does, but
// decided mknod() should just be conservative and check RM/WM/RD/WD/TD.
//
// No need to check quotas here, that's also done in mknod.
//
// NOTE: stream_open() assumes the OS is in a pristine state.  marfs_open()
//       currently always allocates a fresh OS (inside the new FileHandle),
//       so that assumption is safe.  stream_close() doesn't wipe
//       everything clean, because we want some of that info (e.g. how much
//       data was written).  If you decide to start reusing FileHandles,
//       you should probably (a) assure they have been flushed/closed, and
//       (b) wipe them clean.  [See marfs_read(), which sometimes reuses
//       the ObjectStream inside the FileHandle.]

// NOTE: We take an additional set of "stream" flags, which are
//       ultimately passed to stream_open().  These allow the underlying
//       stream to be given different properties, for the needs of fuse
//       versus pftool.  Currently, this is only used for setting CTE on
//       write streams used by fuse.
//
//       For example, Fuse write doesn't know how big the file will be, so
//       it can't tell the server (in the PUT header) how many bytes are
//       going to be written, so it must write with
//       chunked-transfer-encoding, which is somewhat less effecient,
//       especially at the server.  Thus, fuse would use stream_flags ==
//       OSOF_CTE.
//
//       On the other hand, pftool *does* know how big the file it's
//       writing is going to be.  Therefore, pftool could supply
//       stream_flags=0.  The "content-length" header will be computed in
//       stream_write as either (a) the size of the iobuf contents, or (b)
//       the size of the file being copied.  Either way, pftool can't do
//       another write to the same stream (without closing and re-opening),
//       because the content-length header will already have said how much
//       data is coming.
//
// UPDATE: Instead of passing a flag to stream_open() to [not] set CTE, and
//       then another argument to install the content-length, stream_open
//       now just takes a content-length argument.  If zero, it implies
//       writing chunked transfer-encoding for an unknown length.  If
//       non-zero, it implies installing that specific length, and writing
//       non-CTE.

   //     repo.chunk_size of data (which includes the recovery-info at the
   //     end, which we must skip over).

   //     xattr, changing only the final ".0" to the appropriate
   //     chunk-number.
   //
   // These assumptions mean we can easily compute the IDs of chunk(s) we
   // need, given only the read-offset (i.e. the "logical" offset) and the
   // original object-ID.



   // In the case of "Packed" objects, many user-level files are packed

   // to the physical offset of the beginning of the user's object within
   // the packed object, in order to skip over the objects (and their
   // recovery-info) that preceded the "logical object" within the physical

// It appears that, unlike readlink(2), we shouldn't return the number of

// final '\0' into the caller's buf.
//
// NOTE: We do an extra copy to avoid putting anything into the caller's
//     buf until we know that our result is "safe".  This means:
//
//     (a) link-contents are fully "canonicalized"
//     (b) link-contents refer to something in a MarFS namespace, or ...
//     (c) link-contents refer to something in this user's MDFS.
//
//     It's hard to check (b), because canonicalization for (a) seems to
//     require expand_path_info(), and that puts us into MDFS space.  To
//     convert back to "mount space", we'd need the equivalent of
//     find_namespace_by_md_path(), which is thinkable, but more effort
//     than we need to allow.  Instead, we'll just require (c); that the
//     canonicalized name must be in *this* namespace (which is an easier
//     check).
//
// ON SECOND THOUGHT: It's not our job to see where a link points.
//     readlink of "/marfs/ns/mylink" which refers to "../../test" should
//     just return "../../test" The kernel will then canonicalize
//     "/marfs/ns/../../test" and then use that to do whatever the
//     operation was.  We are not allowing any subversion of the MDFS by
//     responding with the contents of the symlink.
