// Reserved Xattrs
//
// Fields in these structures are filled from corresponding xattr values
// attached to files in the MDFS.  The fields in each structure are encoded
// as substrings in a single xattr value string, for the given key.  For
// example, MarFS_XattrPost corresponds to the xattr value with key
// "marfs_post".  This value is a single string, which we parse to get the
// fields of the struct.  The reverse operation (converting a struct to a
// string) is also supported.  Thus, each struct has matching functions to
// parse it from a string, or convert it into a string, which are used when
// reading or writing the xattr value, respectively.
//
// Wouldn't it make sense to code this in C++?  Sure, but we're starting
// with C to avoid any issues with linking precompiled libraries.  After
// we're more clear on the SW architecture (e.g. what needs to link to
// what), conversion to C++ makes a lot of sense.
//
// NOTE: We are currently using lack of xattrs (on an MD file) as an
//       indicator that data is stored directly in the MD file (instead of
//       being stored in an object to which xattrs would refer).  This
//       really means a lack of the complete set of xattrs, needed for
//       MarFS_ReservedXattrs.  (See stat_xattrs(), in common.c)
//
//       You can test for this situation in fuse by doing the following:
//
//       EXPAND_PATH_INFO(&info, path);

// members are formatted into object-names.
//
// NOTE: There is an object-type stored here, but it is only the part of an
//       object type that can be known at obj-open time, by fuse or pftool.
//       (See MarFS_XattrPost, for the true object-type, which can only be
//       known by fuse after the object has been written.)  The point of
//       this field is to indicate whether the object is PACKED, or not.
//       We also capture whether the object was written by Fuse, or not.
//
// NOTE: We record the compression/correction/etc, in addition to the
//       repo-name.  Information about compression/correction can be found
//       in the repo object, but it might presumably be re-configured over
//       time.  We need to know the compression (etc) that an object was
//       actually written with.  So those fields are stored as they were at
//       the time the object was written.  On the other hand, while the
//       authentication-method used by the repository may change, it
//       doesn't help to know what it used to be.
//
// NOTE: A time-stamp was formerly printed in reverse-order, at the
//       high-order (leftmost) end of the object-name, because AWS indexes
//       obj-ids in alphabetical order, and uses the index to respond to
//       GETs, so there would be a penalty for having all the obj-ids
//       stored in the same part of the index (all served by the same
//       servers).  However, we're not using AWS, and our obj-stores do not
//       map obj-ids to servers in the same way, so we're removing this
//       feature.
//
// NOTE: We thought obj_ctime would make trashed versions of a file have a
//       unique object-ID, because the trashed file uses an object-ID that
//       was created then, and this one is created now.  But, obj_ctime is
//       only a time_t (1-second resolution).  If you are overwriting a
//       marfs object that was *just* created, you might get the same
//       object-ID for the new file.  So, do we have fuse wait for a
//       second?  Return an error?  Neither of those seemed acceptable, so
//       I'm adding the "unique" field.  This will always be zero, except
//       for files that were created as a result of truncating another file
//       of the same name, within the same second.

// COMMENTED OUT.  The RecoveryInfo structure is not used during writing of
// recovery-info.  For that, see write_recoveryinfo(), in common.c.
//
// We don't yet support actually reading recovery-info.  During recovery,
// we would want to quickly load the stored recovery-info into a struct.
// We might only be looking to recover files with specific metadata
// properties.  This structure would be used for that purpose.



// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// RecoveryInfo
//
// We capture some metadata info at file-creation time, and store it in the
// object-store, along with the user data.  The purpose is to allow
// regeneration of the key metadata associated with a user's file, should
// the MDFS be damaged or destroyed.  This is only information as it
// existed at creation-time; it isn't maintained during
// chmod/chown/rename/etc.
//
// Recovery-info is currently meant to be human-readable, so it's all just
// ASCII text.  Someday, we can consider optimizing storage of this data
// (and potentially recovery), by saving it in a binary format (e.g. a
// formatted set of network-byte-order values.  In order to avoid any
// dependence on compiler-versions, to determine the specific layout or
// size of the recovery-info, we write it all by hand, in
// write_recoveryinfo().
//
// PACKED objects keep their per-object recovery-info at the tail of their
// local data, within in the larger object, when they are packed together.
// (i.e. [data1][recovery1][packed2][recovery2]...)  This allows packing to
// be done without any reprocessing of the recovery info for the packed
// objects, which remains correct.
//
// Recovery-information is captured at create-time; it is not updated upon
// metadata changes like chmod, chown, rename, etc.  Therefore, yes, it is
// probably out-of-date.  Its purpose is to allow regenerating some
// semblance of the MDFS, using only the contents of objects, in the event
// of a catastrophic meltdown of the MDFS.  It would be disastrous
// performance implications to try to maintain it, after creation.
//
//
// TBD:
//
// We don't actually have any support in place for reading recovery-info
// from objects.  When we do, this structure would be populated with data
// retrieved from the recovery-info in an object.
//
// We don't necessarily want to go to the expense of parsing the PRE and
// POST xattr strings into Pre and Post structs (e.g. if we only want to
// restore certain pathnames, then we only need that parsing after we've
// found a matching pathname.
//
// So, there would probably be two levels of operation for this struct:
//
// (a) capture the strings from the recovery info, without any
//     dynamic-allocation (e.g. just using the buffer holding recovery-info
//     you got form the object.
//
// (b) parse out and initalize Pre, Post, and stat structs, from this info.
//
//
// FORMAT:
//
// // Our goal is to write a fixed size of data, in a format we can read-back,
// // regardless of compiler or compiler-version.  The data is the members of
// // the RecoveryInfo struct, each converted to network-byte-order.  The
// // actual struct generated by the compiler may involve some alignment
// // padding, but padding and (therefore) the size of the struct could change
// // between compilers, or compiler versions.  So, we don't want to just write
// // the serialized structure contents (because they would be byte-order
// // specific), nor even all the fields as individual network-byte-order
// // values (because the padding might be compiler-specific).
// //
// // Therefore, we define a static size which is big enough to store all the
// // members of the struct, and we save them out as a series of
// // correctly-sized, unaligned, network-byte-order bytes, filling that size.
// // We put our own padding at a known spot in the middle.  (See
// // recoveryinfo_2_str(), and str_2_recoveryinfo().)
// //
// // We also need a fixed size that this storage will require, so that
// // e.g. marfs_write() can reserve exactly the proper number of bytes at the
// // tail-end of an object-stream, such that the addition of the RecoveryInfo
// // will fill up the object to exactly Repo.chunk_size, specified in the
// // configuration.
// //
// // We need known values to appear at the very beginning and the very end of
// // the stored data (i.e. version-numbers at the beginning, and data-sizes
// // at the very end), as explained in the RECOVERY section.
// //
// // The simplest thing is to use sizeof(RecoveryInfo) as the criteria for
// // how much storage is needed, though the objects may actually take up
// // less, and insert our own custom padding in a way that doesn't depend on
// // the compiler's layout of structs.
//
//
// RECOVERY:
//
// In the event that metadata is lost, we can recover it in a limited way
// (MD as it existed at the time objects were written), as follows:
//
//   (a) Read the last 8 bytes of data in the object. This holds the size
//       of the RecoveryInfo.
//
//   (b) Read the next-to-last 8 bytes of data.  This holds the size of the
//       data itself (not counting RecoveryInfo).
//
//   (c) Skip to the beginning of the recovery-info.  This points to stored
//       software version numbers.  Call str_2_recoveryinfo().  This will
//       use the version-numbers to understand how to recover the rest of
//       the stored recovery-info into a RecoveryInfo struct.
//
//   (d) Skip to the beginning of the data.  (Using info from step (b).)
//       You can now generate metadata for this object, using the
//       RecoveryInfo.
//
//   (e) If this is a packed object, step (d) might not have moved all the
//       way to the beginning of the object-data.  In that case, go to step
//       (a), again.
//    
//
// NOTE: Now that we are using Scality sproxyd, we have the further problem
//     that you can't easily get a list of "all existing objects".
//     Instead, you'd have to do some grovelling through low-level scality
//     metadata.  But you could do that.
//
// NOTE:  We actually save the object-ID.  Why?  Presumably, if you can read
//     the recovery-info out of the object, then you already have the object-ID, right?
//     In some object-systems (e.g. sproxyd), the user-level object-ID is hashed (etc)
//     to produce the internal key, which is the ID used internally.  Our object-IDs
//     encode some information
//
//

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// We're "hardcoding" the types, to guarantee we know how big each member
// is.  Shouldn't be a problem if this size is larger than the size your
// compiler uses for the corresponding type (e.g. gid_t), as long as you
// aren't trying to recover (e.g.) an inode on a machine that says inode_t
// is 32-bits, where the recovery-info actually has more than 32
// significant digits.
//
// *** WARNING: If you change any of these, you MUST also change
// MARFS_CONFIG_MAJOR/MINOR, in marfs_configuration.h, and the
// recoveryinf_2_str() / str_2_recoveryinfo() functions, to handle the new
// version.

//

// "recovery" blob at the end of each object which is not part of the
// user-data), the checksum, encryption, and compression keys, etc.
//
// All object-IDs are the same as what's in the Pre xattr, differing only
// in chunk-number, so we don't need to store those.
//
// When writing from fuse, we fill every object to the brim before moving
// on to the next one.  Therefore, for any offset into the user-data, we
// can compute the name of the object containing that data.  If something
// fails during a write, and the write is restarted, we start over from
// scratch, and all previous progress is trashed.
//
// However, pftool wants the ability to restart a large copy, picking up
// where it left off.  It also may do an N:1 style of write, so chunks may
// be written out-of-order, such that the existing set after a failure is
// not contiguous.  Therefore, pftool restart needs a way to figure out
// which chunks were written.  (The fact that not all of them were written
// will be indicated by the presence of a RESTART xattr.)
//
// Because we want to be able to compute an offset for chunk-info, and
// simply seek into the MD file to find it, we want all the fields, and the
// chunk-info-records to have known sizes and offsets.  Therfore, we leave
// out the usual human-readability support, and just write raw binary,
// (in network-byte-order).
