//     (a) on a file, the setuid-bit indicates SEMI-DIRECT mode.  In this

//     truncated to corect size, because the underlying FS is parallel, and

//     across multiple writers, so we can correctly trunc the MD file.
//     Instead, we let the parallel FS do that (because it can).  So, to
//     get the size, we need to go stat the PFS file, instead.  If we wrote
//     this flag in an xattr, we'd have to read xattrs for every stat, just
//     so we can learn whether the file-size returned by 'stat' is correct
//     or not.
//
//     (b) on a directory, the setuid-bit indicates MD-sharding.  [FUTURE]
//     In this case, the MD-directory will be a stand-in for a remote MD
//     directory.  We hash on a namespace + directory-inode and lookup that
//     spot in a remote-directory, to get the MD contents.

// OPEN
//
// We maintain a MarFS_FileHandle, which has info needed by
// read/write/close, etc.
//
// Fuse will never call open() with O_CREAT or O_TRUNC.  In the O_CREAT
// case, it will just call maknod() first.  In the O_TRUNC case, it calls
// truncate.  Either way, these flags are stripped off.  We had a
// conversation about the fact that mknod() doesn't have access to the
// open-flags, whereas create() does, but decided mknod() should check
// RM/WM/RD/WD/TD
//
// No need to check quotas here, that's also done in mknod.
//
// TBD: NFS doesn't call mknod!
//
// A FileHandle is dynamically allocated in fuse_open().  We want to make
// sure any error-returns will deallocate the file-handle.  In C++, it's
// easy to get an object to do cleanup when it goes out of scope.  In C, we
// need to add some code before every return, to do any cleanup that might
// be needed before returning.
//



// NOTE: stream_open() assumes the OS is in a pristine state.  fuse_open()
//       currently always allocates a fresh OS (inside the new FileHandle),
//       so that assumption is safe.  stream_close() doesn't wipe
//       everything clean, because we want some of that info (e.g. how much
//       data was written).  If you decide to start reusing FileHandles,
//       you should probably (a) assure they have been flushed/closed, and
//       (b) wipe them clean.  [See fuse_read(), which now performs a
//       distinct S3 request for every call, and reuses the ObjectStream
//       inside the FileHandle.]
//
// NOTE: In the context of fuse, the kernel will call mknod() before
//       open(), if the file doesn't exist.  If the file does exist, the
//       kernel will call ftruncate() after opening.  We've relaied on
//       that.
//
//       However, when exporting the fuse-mount over NFS, we don't get the
//       mknod / ftruncate calls automatically.  Therefore, we have to
//       detect this situation.  The following seem to be appropriate
//       conditions to trigger our own call to ftruncate() in the NFS
//       context only: (a) the file has non-zero size [from getattr()], and
//       (b) the file doesn't have Pre.obj_type==OBJ_Nto1 (as would be the
//       case with pftool down concurrent opens of the file at different
//       offsets).  This is done inside marfs_open(), if needed.
