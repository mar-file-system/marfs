# There's some confusion regarding our use of "version" in the config-file.
# We now realize this probably shouldn't be presumed to be the same as the
# version that goes into object-IDs.  The latter version indicates how to
# parse xattrs, and may also concern the format of chunk-info in MD files,
# or the recovery-info in objects.  Those things are all now dictated by
# #defines MARFS_CONFIG_MAJOR/MINOR, which identify the version of the
# SOFTWARE, rather than the config. (See marfs_configuration.h)

# However, there is also the config-reader, which should be able to know
# whether the config file "version" is something it understands.  So,
# that's what the version in the config-file means.

# Changes in minor version are presumed to be backward-compatible, within
# the same major version.  In other words, if you add fields here, you
# could update the minor version, and your config-reader should be able to
# provide defaults for earlier minor versions which did not have that
# field.  However, that doesn't mean older minor-version parsers will
# correctly handle newer minor-versions.  So, parsers should assure that
# the config file they are reading is not newer than they are.

# The version number in the blueprint is not used anywhere, but it is
# recommended that you update it when you make changes, so that we can tell
# which config files might use updating.
